    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        Near-duplicate image detection is&nbsp;used for searching similar
        images but may also be&nbsp;used for&nbsp;spam detection. Near-duplicate
        images
        may&nbsp;be blacklisted as&nbsp;image spam or&nbsp;number
        of&nbsp;occurrences
        of&nbsp;the&nbsp;nearly same
        image may&nbsp;be calculated. We&nbsp;propose using features extracted
        from the&nbsp;convolutional neural network for the detection task. We
        also propose how to&nbsp;convert the&nbsp;vector to&nbsp;a&nbsp;much
        smaller hash and we compare those
        methods to&nbsp;previously used methods. We&nbsp;did test our&nbsp;solution
        for&nbsp;1000
        publicly available images. We&nbsp;did 5&nbsp;alternations on&nbsp;each
        image
        from the
        dataset (blur, noise, crop, rotate, brightness). Then&nbsp;we&nbsp;tested
        all&nbsp;the&nbsp;algorithms for&nbsp;searching if the&nbsp;original
        image is&nbsp;the&nbsp;closest
        one&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;altered images. Our&nbsp;proposed solution
        performed significantly
        better for&nbsp;this&nbsp;task. Other algorithms were having a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;of&nbsp;false
        positives for&nbsp;cropped and rotated images.

            <p>
                Cluster images extracted from email traffic stream.
                Clustering should be supine to slight alternations, which are
                used by spammers.

            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>
                Because the task requires clustering to unknown number of
                clusters we are searching for image hash representation which
                will define a cluster.<br>
                We are using ImageHash library as a baseline. This library
                offers first 4 hashes in the following list.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Average hashing</b> - Reducing high frequencies.
                    Bilinear downscale (8x8), then convert to grayscale and
                    compute average intensity. Compute bits based on threshold
                    (more or less then average).
                </li>
                <li><b>Perceptual hash</b> - Based on discrete cosine
                    transform. Reduce high frequencies. Compute average
                    value and do the thresholding.
                </li>
                <li><b>Difference hash</b> - Based on gradient direction
                    (difference of adjacent pixels). Bits are computed
                    based on the brightness of the neighbour.
                </li>
                <li><b>Wavelet hash</b> - Based on Haar wavelet which is
                    using Fourier analysis.
                </li>
                <li><b>CNN hash</b> - Our proposed hash method. We are using
                    ResNet
                    for feature vector (hash) extraction. We are using vector of
                    length 2048 extracted from the fully-connected layer after
                    the
                    convolution.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                CNN hash vector is originally 2048 float numbers, which makes
                the hash space too big for our use case. We propose using
                binarization inspired by Average hashing. We used fixed
                threshold 0.5 and average threshold. We used method similar
                to max pooling with window size 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 and
                looked if 1 is present (max reduction) and if average is
                above 0.5 (average reduction)
            </p>
            <p>
                We did several alternations on each image to simulate
                alternations done by spammers.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Blur</b> - Gaussian blur of the image pixels with radius
                    2
                </li>
                <li><b>Crop</b> - Random crop of the image not smaller then 40%
                    of the
                    original
                </li>
                <li><b>Brightness</b> - Making the image lighter or darker up to
                    80%
                </li>
                <li><b>Rotate</b> - Image rotation up to 30 deg</li>
                <li><b>Noise</b> - Adding Gaussian noise to the image</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Distance metrics used for measuring the closest image.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Hamming</b> - This
                    metric computes the number of changes needed for inputs of
                    the same length to make them equal. This metric is used in
                    ImageHash library for comparison of the bits.
                </li>
                <li><b>Cosine</b> - Used for real-valued high dimensional
                    vectors such as our proposed CNN based hash. This metric
                    ignores the magnitude of the vectors.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Experimental results</h2>
            <h3>Dataset</h3>
            <p>
                We used 1000 first images from OpenImages
                database.
            </p>


            <h3>Similarity detection</h3>
            <p>
                We did test if the alternations of the image are the closest
                ones to the original image. The images were sorted based on the
                distance metric and if the alternation was found after some
                other images the score was lowered proportionally to the number
                of false positive images (0-1) shown in Tab. 1 and individual
                alternations in Tab. 2.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                We show the performance of near duplicate image detection
                algorithms on 1000 images. Each of the images was altered with 5
                operations (blur, noise, crop, rotate, brightness). We did
                search the closest images to the original image and shown that
                proposed CNN solution with score 0.98 (max 1) is significantly
                better for that task then simpler similarity detection
                algorithms which scored best 0.1. The feature vector extracted
                from CNN was performing almost the same for all alternations.
                Other hashing algorithms were affected by rotation and mostly by
                crop. We did also test the exact match of the computed hash from
                the altered image to the hash computed from the original image.
                Our simple method for binarization and reduction the feature
                vector achieved up to 13% match while hashing algorithms
                achieved up to 50%. We propose using exact match for
                blacklisting or a tree structure with image representations
                which may be used for creating image buckets for counting
                occurrences.
